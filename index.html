<p>Everyone knows the story of Peter Pan right? Whether you watched the Disney animated film, or the Steven Spielberg sequel Hook, or read the novel as a child.</p>
                            <p>Peter Pan was an idol to many children, the idea of living on a magical island with no grown-ups to tell you what to do and getting to stay young forever is an attractive one. Maybe that last bit is still attractive to some.</p>

                            <p>Everyone knows the Story of Peter Pan, but do you know the story behind the novel?</p>

							<p>Meet the lost children.<br>
                            <em>Dylan a.k.a The boy who will never grow up</em><br><br>
                                Dylan is a real-life Peter Pan - but this isn’t a good thing. He was diagnosed with a rare genetic condition - so rare that it hasn’t been named yet, it is referred to as ‘syndrome without a name’ or SWAN. At Dylan’s Mum’s 20-week scan, the doctor discovered that Dylan’s organs were reversed, and at 27-weeks they found that he wasn’t growing, but getting smaller. <br>His parent’s were told that he had a genetic condition, but they wouldn’t know for sure which one, until he was born. At eight-weeks old, Dylan had his first seizure, followed by ear infections, apnea (temporary moments where he would stop breathing) and throat infections. This was when he was admitted to Great Ormond Street Hospital for treatment. <br>Dylan’s condition means that he’s stuck in the body and mind of a baby. He’s developed up to about nine months in almost five years. <br>The doctors at GOSH labelled his condition as ‘life-limiting’ firstly because of his breathing problems but also because doctors simply don’t know how, or if, he will grow up. The hospital have hired a nurse to deal specifically with undiagnosed children due in part to Dylan and his family, and other families in their position.</p>

                                Dominic loves to play hide and seek with the other lost children in Neverland and his favourite flavour of ice cream is chocolate. Dominic has been coming to Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children since he was a year old.<br><br>His adoptive mother noticed something was wrong, and Dominic was diagnosed with Foetal Alcohol Syndrome, caused by his birth mother drinking alcohol whilst she was pregnant with him. Some of the symptoms of FAS include eyelid drooping, bowel and skeletal problems and the most serious, congenital heart defects. Dominic continues to be a regular visitor to the hospital for check-ups.</p>

							<em>Sophia a.k.a Tinkerbell</em><br><br>
							Sophia likes to visit the mermaids in Neverland, although she never gets too close to the edge of the water, in case they drown her. Sophia was brought to Great Ormond Street hospital at one day old suffering from Meconium Ileus, a blockage in the bowel. <br><br>Thanks to the hardworking staff at Great Ormond Street hospital and the many generous donations from people like you, Sophia underwent surgery at a day old to relive her distended bowel. A few weeks later, and Sophia was finally well enough to leave the hospital with her parents.

                                Zikora loves to practise his sword fighting skills with the pirates in Neverland, and playing ‘happy families’ with the other lost children. Zikora suffered a cardiac arrest when he was just 13 months old. He was admitted to Great Ormond Street Hospital so the dedicated staff could find out what made him have the arrest. <br>Zikora had a heart biopsy, and the doctors discovered that his heart had contracted a virus which caused a condition called Myocarditis. This meant that his heart muscle had become inflamed and the doctors were concerned that his heart would eventually fail. <br>The doctors put Zikora on an artificial heart machine, while he waited for a heart transplant. As soon as Zikora was hooked up to the machine, his condition started to improve, so much so that he was taken off the transplant list and the artificial heart machine, and was allowed to go home with his family.</p>

							<p>Meet the Lost Children<br>
							<em>Imogen a.k.a Wendy</em><br><br>
							Imogen loves playing hide and seek with Dominic and the other lost children in Neverland and eating jam sandwiches and swimming in the blue lagoon. Imogen was rushed to Great Ormond Street Hospital four days after she was born to have keyhole surgery on her heart. The midwives at the hospital in Norwich picked up a murmur in her heart, her mum asked them to do a second examination, during this examination, Imogen crashed. She was diagnosed with Tetralogy of Fallot, which is when four structural abnormalities of the heart happen at the same time. <br><br>At 10 weeks old, Imogen underwent open heart surgery to fix the abnormalities in her heart. Her mum, Ruth had this to say about GOSH; "It was such a hard time for us all but the whole environment at GOSH made it easier. The parent accommodation was ready for us, so we didn’t have to think about that. The staff were all so supportive. The nurses spent a long time explaining what was wrong so that we understood."</p>

							<p>What does the amazing work of the staff at GOSH have to do with <em>Peter Pan</em> you ask?</p>
						</div>
						<div class="bb-custom-side" id="9right">
                                <p>Well, in 1929, author and playwright, J.M Barrie, gave the rights to his novel and play, <em>Peter Pan</em> to Great Ormond Street Hospital.This means that anytime a copy of his novel was purchased or a ticket to his play was sold, the hospital would get a cut of the income. This decision was honoured after his death in 1937.</p>

							<p>Why does the hospital need my help?<br>
							Every year, the doctors and nurse of GOSH work tirelessly to treat the 255,000 patients that come through their doors. They treat children for everything from genetic diseases to infections, and from neurological disorders to organ defects. Researchers at GOSH are participating in pioneering research to find new, better and more effective ways to diagnose, treat and cure diseases.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="bb-custom-side" id="10right">
                                <p>Nurses and counsellors are working with patients and their families to make their hospital stays as short, and hassle-free as possible, providing overnight accommodation and in some cases meals and financial support.<br>
The royalties from <em>Peter Pan</em> help a lot to the day to day running of the hospital, but by no means covers all of the costs of the research and services they offer.<br>
In short, Great Ormond Street Hospital needs your help to keep doing the amazing work they’ve been doing since the hospital first opened its doors in 1852.</p>
